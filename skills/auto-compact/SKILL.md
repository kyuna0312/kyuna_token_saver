# Auto Compact

Configure Claude Code to automatically compact conversation history when context approaches its limit, preventing hard stops and maintaining session continuity.

## What Compaction Does

When context window fills:
- **Without compaction**: Claude stops responding, session breaks
- **With compaction**: Claude summarizes old conversation, frees space, continues

Compaction preserves:
- Current task state
- Recent file edits
- Active errors being debugged

Compaction discards:
- Old conversation turns
- Previously loaded file contents no longer needed
- Resolved intermediate steps

## Enable Auto Compaction

### Option 1: Settings File

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) or `.claude/settings.json` (project):

```json
{
  "compactOnContextFull": true,
  "compactThreshold": 0.85
}
```

`compactThreshold: 0.85` = trigger compaction at 85% context usage.

### Option 2: During Session

To trigger manual compaction now:

```
/compact
```

Claude will summarize current context and continue with reduced token usage.

### Option 3: PreCompact Hook

Configure hook to run before compaction for custom summary logic:

```json
{
  "PreCompact": [{
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "bash $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/pre-compact.sh",
      "timeout": 15
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Compact Trigger Prompt

To manually compact with preserved context, use:

```
Compact context now.

Preserve:
- Current task: [TASK]
- Active files: [FILES]
- Current errors: [ERRORS IF ANY]

Summarize everything else. Continue where we left off.
```

## Monitor Context Usage

Check current context fill level:
- Claude Code shows context usage in status line
- At 70%+ usage: consider voluntary compaction
- At 85%+ usage: auto-compact triggers (if enabled)
