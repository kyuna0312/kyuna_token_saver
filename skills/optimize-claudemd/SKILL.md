# Optimize Claude.md

Read, analyze, and rewrite `claude.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) to reduce token cost while preserving all meaningful constraints. Target: under 300 tokens.

## Step 1: Find and Read the File

Check these locations in order:
1. `./CLAUDE.md` (project root)
2. `./claude.md`
3. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global)
4. `~/.claude/claude.md`

Read the file. Count approximate word count.

## Step 2: Analyze Content

Categorize each section:

| Category | Keep? | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Coding style rules | Yes | Compress to bullets |
| Project structure | Yes | One-line per item |
| Important constraints | Yes | Keep verbatim |
| Pleasantries / tone instructions | Maybe | Cut if not essential |
| Repeated instructions | No | Remove duplicates |
| Obvious defaults | No | Remove ("always use git" etc.) |
| Long explanations | No | Replace with one-line rule |
| Examples longer than 3 lines | No | Remove or move to references/ |

## Step 3: Rewrite

Apply these compression rules:

1. **Bullets over prose** — Replace paragraphs with bullet lists
2. **Imperative tense** — "Use TypeScript strict mode" not "You should use TypeScript strict mode"
3. **No justifications** — Remove "because X" explanations
4. **Merge related rules** — Combine similar rules into one line
5. **Cut obvious defaults** — Remove anything Claude does by default anyway

Target structure:
```markdown
# Project: [NAME]
Stack: [tech stack, one line]

## Code Style
- [rule 1]
- [rule 2]

## Constraints
- [hard constraint 1]
- [hard constraint 2]

## Structure
- [key path 1]: [purpose]
- [key path 2]: [purpose]
```

## Step 4: Show Diff and Confirm

Present:
```
BEFORE: ~[N] words (~[N*1.3] tokens)
AFTER:  ~[N] words (~[N*1.3] tokens)
Reduction: [%]%
```

Show the optimized version. Ask user to confirm before writing.

## Step 5: Write File

On confirmation, overwrite the file with the optimized version.
