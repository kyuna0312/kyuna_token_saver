# Project Isolation

Constrain Claude's context to only the current project. Prevents cross-project memory contamination and eliminates irrelevant context that wastes tokens.

## The Problem

By default, Claude Code loads:
- Global memory files (`~/.claude/memory/`)
- All session history
- Global `claude.md`
- All installed plugins

This causes token waste and context pollution when working on one project.

## Create Project Scope

### Step 1: Create project-local claude.md

In the project root, create or update `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Project Scope

This is an isolated project context.

EXCLUDE from context:
- Global memory files
- Other project histories  
- Plugins: [list plugins not relevant to this project]

INCLUDE only:
- Files in this repository
- Current conversation

Project: [PROJECT NAME]
Stack: [e.g., Next.js, PostgreSQL]
Key constraints: [e.g., no external dependencies, TypeScript strict mode]
```

### Step 2: Instruct Claude at Session Start

Paste this at the start of each isolated session:

```
Create new project scope.

Only include:
- Files in current repository: [PATH]
- This conversation

Exclude:
- Global memory
- Other project context
- Previous unrelated sessions

Confirm isolated context before continuing.
```

### Step 3: Verify Isolation

After applying, Claude should confirm:
- Current working directory
- Active repository
- No references to other projects

If Claude references another project, repeat isolation prompt.

## Per-Project Plugin Config

Create `.claude/settings.local.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "enabled": ["plugin-relevant-to-this-project"],
    "disabled": ["unrelated-plugin-1", "unrelated-plugin-2"]
  }
}
```

This scopes plugin loading to project needs only.
