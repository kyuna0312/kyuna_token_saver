# Manage Skills

Audit and reduce skill token overhead. Skills silently consume 1,000-28,000 tokens each when loaded. This skill helps identify, estimate cost of, and disable unnecessary skills.

## Token Cost of Skills

Each loaded skill SKILL.md body costs tokens every response:
- Small skill: ~500-1,000 tokens
- Medium skill: ~1,500-3,000 tokens  
- Large skill: ~3,000-5,000 tokens
- Plugin with 10 skills: potentially 15,000-50,000 tokens constant overhead

## Audit Loaded Skills

To identify which skills are active, instruct user to run:

```bash
# List all installed plugins and their skills
ls ~/.claude/plugins/

# Check active plugin config
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -i plugin
```

Then read and report:
1. Each plugin name
2. Number of skills per plugin
3. Estimated token cost per skill (check SKILL.md word count)

## Disable Unnecessary Skills

### Disable entire plugin:

Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and set plugin enabled to false, or remove plugin from active list.

### Request selective loading:

Tell user to add to their `claude.md`:

```markdown
## Skill Loading Policy
Only load skills when explicitly requested with /skill-name.
Do not auto-load skills based on conversation context.
Disabled plugins: [list plugins not needed]
```

## Recommended Minimal Skill Set

For most coding sessions, keep only:
- `coding` — core development
- `terminal` — shell operations

Disable: design skills, data skills, SEO skills, marketing skills unless actively needed.

## Estimate Skill Token Cost

For each skill directory, estimate cost:

```bash
# Count words in all SKILL.md files
find ~/.claude/plugins -name "SKILL.md" -exec wc -w {} \; | sort -n
```

Skills over 3,000 words = high cost. Consider disabling or requesting optimization.
